# April 28th: 
Created the project and placed down all the components for the schematic, and wired them together. Once finished, turned the schematic into a PCB.
Realized I had chosen the wrong resistor, went back and redid the resistor wiring (made a mental note to emphasize the component selection aspect during the workshop on Thursday).
Finished the outline of the PCB and started figuring out the placement of components on the board.

Browsed through default fonts but none were speaking to me. Went online and spent a long time looking through different types of fonts to use for this project.
Found 4 potential candidates and ended up using Belgiano. (Made a mental note to self for next week's lesson.) Also went on GitHub and downloaded the plugin for image importation.
Not the best plugin though, tried to see if we could fix the pixelated image through converting things, but it did not work. Will work on this more later.

AP exams finally over. I powered through the design process today and made a lot of stylistic choices to make the card visually appealing on the front.
Back side looks lacking though, so I browsed through some examples and was inspired by this one (https://www.instructables.com/PCB-Business-Card-With-NFC/) but I'm not sure about having the lightbulb since it's a bit basic. I asked ChatGPT and really liked
the code aspects. Maybe I’ll decorate the backside with lines of code. Tried it and hated the look, will ponder more on this.

# May 26th: 
Decided to do a design with binary on the soldermask layer. After placing one phrase down it looked really cool, so I chose a couple more phrases—some are actual lines of code, while others are
random things I found cool :) Had to position the binary around the components on the back, spent a lot of time lining everything up.

**Total time spent: 4h**

Didn't like all the components on the back, so I moved everything to the front side of the card and repositioned the binary design so there aren't
spaces where the components used to be. I did this like 3 times because i keep on going back and forth about if i want it on front or back.

# June 4th: 
A student from my workshop discovered the built-in image importer and it works better than the plugin did. I went online and searched up a lot of possible images and uploaded them onto my board to fill in the
awkward blank spots on the front side. still looks a bit empty tho...

# June 7th: 
I added a ruler design (and hopefully it's
to scale). I tried like 4 different ones and 3 of them looked really off-scale, but the one I ended up choosing looks really promising. I was inspired by this image ()

From June 2nd to June 25th, I was helping other students with their hack cards every day for one hour. They were able to finish their projects, however by that time Onboard had already ended :(
I promised them I'll keep an eye out so that their hard work isn't in vain. (They spent like 3 months on this and everyone was excited to get them made.)
